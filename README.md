# üõ°Ô∏è Branch Access Policies

This document outlines the branch access policies for our version control system (VCS). These policies help safeguard critical branches, ensure code quality, and define who has access to perform actions like merging or pushing directly to branches.

## üîê Branch Protection Rules

Branch protection rules ensure that important branches (like `main` or `release` branches) remain stable and free from unreviewed or unapproved changes. These rules can enforce code reviews, testing, and approval workflows.

### Key Protection Rules:

1. **Protected Branches:**
   - **Main Branch (`main` or `master`)**: This branch should always contain production-ready code. No direct commits are allowed.
   - **Release Branches (`release/vX.X.X`)**: Used for final preparations of new versions. Direct commits are not permitted; only pull requests (PRs) or merge requests (MRs) are allowed.

2. **Mandatory Code Reviews:**
   - All commits to protected branches must go through at least one approved **code review** before they are merged.
   - At least one reviewer must approve the code before merging.

3. **Status Checks:**
   - CI/CD pipelines must pass all tests before merging. Merges to protected branches are blocked if any required tests fail.

4. **Commit Signing:**
   - Only signed commits are allowed on protected branches, ensuring that each commit is verified.

5. **Merge Strategy:**
   - **Merge requests (MRs)** must follow a fast-forward or rebase strategy to maintain a clean Git history.
   - Squash commits are encouraged to keep the history readable.

6. **Force Push Restrictions:**
   - **Force pushing** is disabled on protected branches to prevent overwriting history.

7. **Tagging and Releases:**
   - Only maintainers or project admins can create or delete **tags** on the `release` and `main` branches.

## üîë Access Policies

Access policies define the roles and permissions for users, ensuring that only authorized personnel can make changes to certain branches.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):

1. **Developers:**
   - Can push changes to **feature** and **bugfix** branches.
   - Cannot push directly to **protected branches** (e.g., `main`, `release`).
   - Must submit merge requests (MRs) to protected branches for review.

2. **Maintainers:**
   - Have permission to **merge** merge requests into **protected branches**.
   - Can approve merge requests and perform **tagging** and **release** operations.

3. **Admins:**
   - Have full control over the repository, including the ability to bypass certain branch protection rules if necessary (e.g., hotfixes).
   - Can manage **branch protection rules** and access levels.

4. **Guests/Reporters:**
   - Can only view the repository, submit issues, and comment on merge requests.
   - No write access or the ability to push to any branch.

## üìù Conclusion

Establishing and enforcing branch access policies and protection rules is critical to maintaining the integrity of the codebase. By implementing branch protection rules and role-based access controls, we can ensure that only authorized changes make it to important branches like `main` and `release`. These policies help promote code quality, security, and collaboration by requiring code reviews, passing tests, and enforcing a consistent Git history.

By adhering to these policies, teams can confidently manage code contributions and maintain a stable, production-ready branch at all times.
