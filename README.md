## üìù Overview

The VCS Notification System monitors and alerts teams about activity in their version control system. It tracks new branches, commits, merges, and tag creations, sending real-time notifications to email or integrated communication platforms like Slack, Microsoft Teams, or GitLab/GitHub Issues.

### Key Features:
- Automatic notifications for new branches, commits, merges, and tags.
- Supports multiple communication channels for notifications.
- Easily customizable to meet specific workflow needs.
- Integrates with CI/CD pipelines for real-time status updates.



## üìõ Naming Conventions

Consistent naming conventions help ensure that everyone on the team can quickly understand what each branch, tag, and commit represents.

### Branch Naming Template

Branches should follow a clear naming structure to reflect the purpose and type of work being done. Here's a recommended branch naming convention:



#### Branch Type Examples:
- `feature/`: Used for new features or functionalities.
- `bugfix/`: Used for fixing a specific bug.
- `hotfix/`: Urgent fixes to be deployed directly to production.
- `release/`: Prepares the codebase for a release.
- `test/`: Temporary branches for experiments or testing.

#### Examples:
- `feature/123-add-login-page`
- `bugfix/456-fix-login-issue`
- `hotfix/789-patch-critical-bug`
- `release/v1.0.0`

### Tag Naming Template

Tags are used to mark specific points in the repository's history, typically for releases or important events. A recommended template for tags is:


#### Example:
- `v1.0.0` ‚Äì First official release
- `v2.1.3` ‚Äì Patch version for minor fixes

### Commit Message Format

A clear and consistent commit message format makes it easier to understand the history and purpose of changes.

#### Commit Message Template:
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

[optional body]
```

#### Commit Types:
- **feat**: A new feature.
- **fix**: A bug fix.
- **docs**: Documentation updates.
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (formatting).
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
- **test**: Adding or fixing tests.
- **chore**: Maintenance tasks, such as configuration updates.
